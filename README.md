# Border Entry Traffic Analysis and Forecasting Using Machine Learning

This project is a comprehensive data analysis and forecasting tool built to study **US border entry traffic**, primarily focusing on the **US-Mexico (US-MX)** and **US-Canada (US-CN)** land borders. The goal is to uncover insights related to border traffic trends, detect anomalies, forecast future activity, and classify high-risk ports using **machine learning models**.

---

## üìå Project Goals

This project addresses several core objectives:

1. **Anomaly Detection**  
   Identify unusual traffic patterns at border ports using Isolation Forest to flag anomalies in traffic volume.

2. **High-Risk Port Prediction**  
   Use Random Forest Classification to detect and predict high-risk ports based on z-scores, season, and geographic data.

3. **Traffic Normalization**  
   Normalize traffic by population and calculate z-scores to assess deviations from seasonal norms.

4. **Forecasting Future Traffic**  
   Apply linear regression to forecast traffic at all ports over the next 10 years (2026‚Äì2036), then rank them yearly.

5. **Seasonal and Temporal Patterns**  
   Understand how traffic, anomalies, and high-risk labels vary by **season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)** and **month**.

6. **Top Transportation Modes**  
   Analyze the most used transport methods (e.g., trucks, buses, pedestrians) for entry into the US.

## üî¨ Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Normalization**
   - Calculate total traffic by (`state`, `year`, `month`)
   - Normalize using population data per state
   - Compute `z-score` of traffic to measure deviation

2. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Use Isolation Forest on normalized traffic values
   - Flag records with anomaly scores < 0 as anomalies

3. **High-Risk Prediction**
   - Label ports in top 10% of z-score as risky
   - Train Random Forest model using:
     - `year`, `month`, `state_code`, `season_code`
     - `traffic_density`, `traffic_z_score`, `traffic_per_capita`

4. **Forecast Future Traffic**
   - Aggregate historical traffic per port/year
   - Fit linear regression models per port
   - Predict traffic for 2026‚Äì2036
   - Rank busiest ports per year

5. **Find Busiest Months**
   - For the top 10 busiest ports, find the busiest month in each year
   - Create count plot of most frequent peak months

6. **Top Transportation Methods**
   - Rank `measure` types (trucks, pedestrians, etc.) by total traffic volume
   - Display the top 5 transportation modes
